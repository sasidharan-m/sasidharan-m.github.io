            <h9> Hi! I'm Sasidharan Mahalingam. I'm a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.pdx.edu">Portland State University</a>. 
                I am currently part of the <a href="https://www.computational.camera">Computational Imaging Group</a> and advised by <a href="https://www.atulingle.com">Dr. Atul Ingle</a>.
                Before that I was a Computer Vision Engineer at <a href="https://www.inferq.com">Inferigence Quotient</a>. 
                I did my Master of Science in Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu">University of California - Santa Cruz</a>.
                I was part of the <a href="https://vision.soe.ucsc.edu/welcome-ucsc-computer-vision-lab"> Computer Vision Lab </a> at UCSC, advised by <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~manduchi/">Dr. Roberto Manduchi</a>.
                I have worked in multiple software and hardware engineer positions at 
                <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html">Intel</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/">Nvidia</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/">Garmin</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>.
                My interest in technology lies in the intersection of Computational Imaging, Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. 
                I aspire to create cameras of the future that have applications in autonomous driving, photography and augumented and virtual reality.

            <h2>Current Projects:</h2>
            <h4>Seg-Cam</h4>
            <p> Working on a camera that generates a superpixel image on the fly without capturing the actual high fidelity image. </p>
            <h4>Learning to generate Light-Fields from a single RGB image</h4>
            <p> Working on a neural network that generates Light Fields from an input RGB image. </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Past Projects:</h2>
            <h4><a href="./assets/project_documentation/face-tracking.pdf">Face Tracking using Commodity Depth Cameras</a></h4>
            <video height="150" playsinline autoplay muted loop src="./assets/project_documentation/out.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <p> Implemented a Generalized ICP algorithm with an initial SHOT3D feature based alignment and a drift correction update step to estimate the pose of the face using Intel D400 series depth cameras. This was my Master's final project at UC Santa Cruz. </p>
            <h4>A simple 3D Scanner using RGBD cameras</h4>
            <p> Created a simple 3D reconstruction program and builds a 3D model from multi view setup using Intel D400 series depth cameras. </p>
            <h4>Defect-Cam</h4>
            <p> Developed a custom camera that performs a 3D to 2D mapping that preserves all 360 degree viewpoints. This type of a camera has applications in fields like defect identification and quality inspection. </p>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/sasidharan-m/RayTracer">Simple Raytracer</a></h4>
            <p> Implemented a simple RayTracing program in C++ </p>
            <h4>Plane Sweeping Multiview Stereo Camera</h4>
            <p> Implemented a multiview stereo system using the plane sweeping algorithm </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Software/Programs:</h2>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/sasidharan-m/pcl">Custom PCL port with support for Intel D400 series cameras</a></h4>
            <p> Developed a custom port of the PCL open source library to support D400 series cameras in 2019. This work was done a part of my Master's project at UC Santa Cruz. </p>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/sasidharan-m/Learn-OpenGL">OpenGL Learning Resource</a></h4>
            <p> I maintain a repo that contains example and excercise programs for the "Learn OpenGL - Graphics Programming" book. Hope beginners in OpenGL find it useful. </p>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/sasidharan-m/Learn-WebGL">WebGL Learning Resource</a></h4>
            <p> I also maintain a repo for WebGL programming. This contains the example and excercise programs for the "WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL" book. Hope this will help people getting started in WebGL.
        </p>

            <h2>Publications:</h2>
            <p> I do not have any publications yet. I am working on a few projects that I am hoping to publish by the end of 2025. Check back later for more updates. </p>
